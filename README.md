# Garage-App

This is the project of term 2 in university for "Advanced Programming" lesson.
It is all about a garage, which is able to add, edit and remove cars from its database. The database is a simple txt file (I wasn't famaliar with concepts like json or xml). Since it is a garage management app, you can add garages and also add cars to every individual garage. People can also rent cars from these garages.

There is a panel which desplays the total revenue.
This project is not perfect, since it doesn't carry the fundamental principles of programming e.g object-oriented programming or file organizing. It doesn't mean that it is useless. It was **one of the best of its kind at the time**. 😃

### If this "Garage App" is naive why did you upload that on [GitHub](https://github.com)?
That's actually a good question 😉. My aim is to contribute to open-source community and this project is useful for those who are new to Java programming language.
